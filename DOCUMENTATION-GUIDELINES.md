## Markdown best practices

- Don't use too many levels of heading: no more than 2-3 levels
- Use lists: helps readability
- Make links descriptive: not "click here" or "read more"
- Link to external resources: use full URL, not relative link
- Add a table of contents: easier to navigate content
- Use alt text for images: helps search engines and screen readers
- Semantic line breaks
  - A semantic line break MUST occur after a sentence, as punctuated by a period (.), exclamation mark (!), or question mark (?).
  - A semantic line break SHOULD occur after an independent clause as punctuated by a comma (,), semicolon (;), colon (:), or em dash (—).
